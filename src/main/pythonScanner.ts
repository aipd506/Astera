/** Python interpreter discovery. The pure decisions (candidate paths, output parsing, which `where`
 *  lines to drop) live in core/run/python.ts; this is the main-only layer that actually runs fs.access
 *  and execFile against those results — the same split as jdkScanner.ts.
 *
 *  Cached per project, like jdkScanner's cache (a promise, so two opens at once share one scan). It
 *  was once left uncached on purpose: a venv is created inside the project *while the app is open*
 *  (`python -m venv .venv` in the project terminal is the ordinary way to start), and a cache that
 *  never invalidated hid it until a restart. So the cache is keyed on which of the project's venv
 *  interpreters exist — two fs.access calls, checked on every open — and on the PATH string; a venv
 *  appearing or going away, or PATH changing (a late login-shell PATH), rescans. What stays cached is the expensive part: `where`/`which` and every `--version`
 *  probe, which on a machine with the Store alias on PATH could hold the dialog for seconds each time
 *  it opened. */
